# Linear Time Properties

Symbolic notation for labels of transition:

If AP is a set of atomic propositions and fi is a propositional formula over AP, then q --> p under fi stands for the set of transitions q --> p under A where A satisfies the conditions of fi.

The propositional formulae over set AP can be written as a set of conditions such as true, any member(s) of the atomic proposition, boolean logic, negation, etc.

A **linear time property** (LT property) E over the set of atomic propositions AP is a subset of(2^AP)^omega (sigma to the power omega; any subset of all possible infinite length word)

E is called an **omega-regular property** iff there exists an omega-regular expression y (gamma) over sigma (the alphabet) such that E = Lw(y)

Remember that the powerset (2^AP) of a set of atomic propositions AP constitutes the alphabet. The alphabet includes empty, as well as all subsets of members of AP.
